    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As a data scientist, I possess more than 4 years of hands-on experience in developing data-driven solutions for clients. 
	Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered tangible business value to two prominent companies. 
	One of the key aspects that sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to meeting deadlines and delivering solutions, which has garnered appreciation from clients on numerous occasions.
	I have a strong affinity for problem-solving and take pride in approaching challenges with creativity and innovation. 
	Additionally, I actively stay abreast of the latest technological advancements, dedicating my free time to continuous learning and skill development.</p>
	<h1>Business impacts</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>Secured a client project at TCS by effectively reproducing a statistical model, replacing the client's paid software and delivering significant business value to two companies.</li>
	  <li>Saved 20% in the cost involved in detecting a network failure for the client using analytics</li>
	  <li>Created an efficient Python code capable of identifying the top N noun phrases within a dataset of approximately 10GB, covering both positive and negative reviews.The code was deployed in production</li>
	  <li>Designed and implemented a plagiarism detection model and deployed to thwart unauthorized account usage on behalf of authenticated users. This model was crafted for a startup and laid a robust groundwork for effective plagiarism detection.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Appreciations I received</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>I had the privilege of working with Anesh during his time at RadicalX, and I can confidently attest to his brilliance and dedication. His self-motivation and tireless work ethic were truly exceptional, making him a reliable asset to our team. His innovative thinking and technical prowess consistently yielded outstanding results, and his collaborative spirit combined with his ability to do exceptional work independently ("We can't solve this problem? If we give it to Anesh he'll solve it within 24 hours") enriched our projects and really made him stand out! Anesh is not only a remarkable engineer but also an individual of integrity and reliability. I highly recommend him to any organization seeking an exceptional talent!</p>
